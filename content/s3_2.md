# Rehashing

You can redo the operations from [last time]({{< ref "s3.md" >}}) with the expanded toolkit of `aws s3api`, but there are more flags to manage.  For example, to put an object onto s3:

```
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket betteraws-more-cat-gifs
{
    "Location": "/betteraws-more-cat-gifs"
}

$ aws s3api list-objects --bucket betteraws-more-cat-gifs

$ aws s3api put-object --bucket betteraws-more-cat-gifs --key more-shaq.gif --body cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
{
    "ETag": "\"1ec35ab1efd1d8fada033cb5ab546d66\""
}

$ aws s3api list-objects --bucket betteraws-more-cat-gifs
{
    "Contents": [
        {
            "Key": "more-shaq.gif",
            "LastModified": "2019-09-05T00:59:04.000Z",
            "ETag": "\"1ec35ab1efd1d8fada033cb5ab546d66\"",
            "Size": 2028508,
            "StorageClass": "STANDARD",
            "Owner": {
                "DisplayName": "my-name",
                "ID": "23d0391795e075ee9c565f104baaa9b31f2b096fe75bf622cd0c85f84bee0715"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

# Access from the browser

But how can we see things online to demonstrate that they work?

Because I am working in us-east-1, the s3 URI for my bucket is `http://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/betteraws-more-cat-gifs` or `http://betteraws-more-cat-gifs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`.  But it is not accessible:

```
This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.
<Error>
<Code>AccessDenied</Code>
<Message>Access Denied</Message>
<RequestId>C2BBD7D3965574CF</RequestId>
<HostId>
vAQjCyWMaljH5ZcX7g/uL672pG5FZxZZUamJxONFwvReRvBIuimEPwIFd7sQ/8tJ+SHxukbpy5Q=
</HostId>
</Error>
```

By default, bucket owners get access to things they make, but randos don't.  We need to apply a policy to make this endpoint publicly readable.

This will be our `public-policy.json`:

```
{
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::betteraws-more-cat-gifs/*"
      }
    ]
}
```

```
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket betteraws-more-cat-gifs --policy file://content/policies/public-policy.json
```

Now when we hit `http://s3.amazonaws.com/betteraws-more-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles.gif`, we get a download of the file.  Progress!  But how do we see it in browser?

## Display in the browser

Unfortunately, we need to update object attributes and we can't do that in place.  If we tried to update like so:

**Wrong**
```
$ aws s3api put-object --bucket betteraws-more-cat-gifs --key more-shaq.gif --content-type image/gif
```

then we would see that the object now has no data:

```
$ aws s3api head-object --bucket betteraws-more-cat-gifs --key more-shaq.gif
{
    "AcceptRanges": "bytes",
    "LastModified": "Thu, 05 Sep 2019 02:17:47 GMT",
    "ContentLength": 0,  # Note this right here
    "ETag": "\"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\"",
    "ContentType": "image/gif",
    "Metadata": {}
}
```

so we need to assert everything all at once:

```
aws s3api put-object --bucket betteraws-more-cat-gifs --key more-shaq.gif --content-type image/gif --metadata foo=bar --body cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
```

And then it works!  (At `http://s3.amazonaws.com/betteraws-more-cat-gifs/more-shaq.gif`)

As a brief note, observe how the metadata we set got translated into the `x-amz-` version.  There are flags for the HTTP headers you would want to set on an object, and the metadata is for "everything else".

There is a _ton_ more that is possible with all the flags and commands in the docs, but most of them don't matter for the common user.  (For example, legal holds, requester-pays, tag sets).  You can explore ACLs, logging, and lifecycles, or we may come back to them later.
