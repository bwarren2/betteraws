# Intro

In the spirit of there being one, and only one, right way to do things, there are three different s3 cli namespaces.  Broadly, they are:

1. Analogues of the basic unix operations, like `cp`, `ls`, `rm`, `mv`, and create/delete bucket.
2. Everything else supported for s3 stuff, like acl policies, inventory policies, cors, encryption, etc.
3. Batch operation CRUD ops.

## High level overview

s3 is a key-value store that looks like a filestore.  A bucket is a namespace that must be unique across all of s3.  Keys can look like /`mybucket/foo.png`, `mybucket/foo/bar/gif`, etc.

# Basic Operations

In the spirit of the internet, our examples will all be moving cat gifs across the web.  Specifically, `cat-shaq-wiggles.gif`:

<img src="/cat-shaq-wiggles.gif" />

## Make a bucket

Like last time:

```
$ aws s3 mb s3://betteraws-cat-gifs --profile s3user
make_bucket: betteraws-cat-gifs
```

Note that I am using the user we gave s3 permissions last time.  From here, I will omit the profile argument by setting `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=s3user`


Note also the `s3://`.  That prefix will be how we designate s3-side resources.

## See it is empty

```
$ aws s3 ls s3://betteraws-cat-gifs
$
```
(No output)

## Put something in the bucket, move it around

```
$ aws s3 mv cat-shaq-wiggles.gif s3://betteraws-cat-gifs
move: ./cat-shaq-wiggles.gif to s3://betteraws-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
```

```
aws s3 ls s3://betteraws-cat-gifs
2019-09-04 20:17:41    2028508 cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
```

ðŸ™Œ

But wait, now our local copy is gone!  Let's get it back.

```
aws s3 cp s3://betteraws-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles .
fatal error: An error occurred (404) when calling the HeadObject operation: Key "cat-shaq-wiggles" does not exist
```

The suffix is necessary when `cp`ing something down, so:

```
aws s3 cp s3://betteraws-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles.gif .
download: s3://betteraws-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles.gif to ./cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
$ ls
cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
```

Mr. O'Neil's time is expensive, so let's not make him wait on s3 for too long.

```
$ aws s3 rm s3://betteraws-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles
delete: s3://betteraws-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles
```

but wait...

```
$ aws s3 ls s3://betteraws-cat-gifs
2019-09-04 20:17:41    2028508 cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
```

While the delete _looks_ like it succeeded, it definitely did not.  Actually get rid of it:

```
$ aws s3 rm s3://betteraws-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
delete: s3://betteraws-cat-gifs/cat-shaq-wiggles.gif
$ aws s3 ls s3://betteraws-cat-gifs
$
```

Why does the `cp` complain about a missing key, but the delete happily act like nothing is wrong?  Probably concurrency or something.  AWS is full of these kinds of behaviors to stub your toe on, so watch out.
